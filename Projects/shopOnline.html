            <p>Shop-Online is designed to increase user experience by targeting simplicity through design and layout. What makes this website fun is the multiple ways in which the user can add products to the page. The first is on the main page with a quick add function, the products displayed is the the top trending products of the page. The second is on the cataloge page where there is also a quick add function. The last is when the user go into the product and add the product. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Each time the user adds the product the user get's notified of the total, this helps the user tack the expenses without having to go to the cart. The cart will display all the products as well as the total. The user is able to remove any items from the cart, this is the only way the user can remove items.</p>
            <p>
                The checkout page is a beautiful form created using bootstrap. If the user selects the delivery option the price will increase depending on the delivery option. Once the user checks out the purchase reference will be displayed to the user, the cart will also be emptied. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                This page is only using front end technologies, backend technologies will be added later as well as more effects and products. One feature that will still come is the amount of items the user can add for a product.
